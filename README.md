The goal of this project was to replicate and image by writing the code for the html.index file ,  the javascript and the css using node-sass.

This was the first project that had us actively use jQuery with the files; which made it quicker (using jQuery)... previously we have become familiar with the long-hand version(writing it out from scratch), but we are being introduced the evolution that is going on in technology, gradually.
