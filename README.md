The goal of this project was to replicate and image by writing the code for the html.index file , the javascript, and the css , via node-sass.

This was the first project that had us actively use jQuery with the files; which made it quicker (using jQuery)... previously we have become familiar with the long-hand version(writing it out from scratch), but we are gradually being introduced to the advances in technology that has made it quicker to complete the simple tasks.
